// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening.
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;
number++;
if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}
*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
//If the number is equal to or greater than 2, console.log yes
//
//
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';
if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}
*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// If the string "Mary" is the exact same as the name, than console.log "Hi, Mary!"
//If not, then it logs "how do you do?"
//
//

//CODE
/*
let secret;
let code = 123;
if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}
if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}
console.log(secret)
*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
//multiplies the code which is 123 by 2, then checks if code is greater than 250
// which it's not so it console.logs super secret
//
//

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;
if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}
*/




// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code.
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2.
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;
// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;
if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}
*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;
if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

// colors strings don't match the value - fix the strings
// if statement only makes colorOne change to purple
// nothing to check if the values are true to make purple,
// makes colorOne and colorTwo pointless


//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

// change cont to left
//

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;
if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

// the console.log will reply with "no entry" as the minAge = age
// suggest using better ages as both variables equal each other or use ===
// since they are of the same number value

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;
if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
} else {
  console.log('enter');
}
